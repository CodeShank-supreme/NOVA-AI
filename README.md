# NOVA-AI
A powerful AI Robot Assitant with realtime capabilites and many more functions

This is my AI assistant project, called NOVA. It’s a multimodal assistant that combines voice, vision, and automation. Here’s what it does:

Wake Word Detection:
NOVA is always listening for the phrase “Hey Nova” using the Porcupine engine. When it hears the wake word, it wakes up and gets ready to help.

Face Recognition:
When activated, NOVA uses the webcam and Dlib to recognize faces. If it recognizes someone, it loads their personalized memory file and greets them by name.

Email Integration:
NOVA can fetch the latest email from my Gmail inbox and can also send emails to people I’ve added to its contact list.

Web Search & Weather:
It can search Google for information and scrape detailed answers. It also fetches current weather and a 3-day forecast for Singapore.

YouTube Music Playback:
If I ask it to play a song, it searches YouTube and plays the top result in my browser.

Speech Recognition & Conversation:
NOVA uses Vosk for real-time speech-to-text and OpenAI’s GPT model for generating responses, so I can have a natural conversation with it.

Text-to-Speech:
It replies using Microsoft Edge TTS, so I hear its responses out loud.

Vision (Image Analysis):
NOVA can take a photo with the webcam and send it to OpenAI’s Vision API to analyze the image and answer questions about it.

Arduino Integration:
It communicates with an Arduino over serial to control hardware—like aligning itself to my face or displaying emotions.

Memory System:
NOVA saves and loads memories for each user, including context like date, time, and weather, so it can give more personalized responses.

Overall, NOVA is designed to be a smart, interactive assistant that can see, hear, speak, remember, and even control hardware—all in one system.
